# Get data

```{r, eval = F}
# csv file (will need conversion to an sf object)
frames_df = read.csv("https://github.com/GretaTimaite/pedestrian_simulation/releases/download/data/gcs_frames.csv")
```

```{r}
# geojson (an sf object)
frames_sf = sf::st_read("https://github.com/GretaTimaite/pedestrian_simulation/releases/download/data/gcs_frames.geojson")
```

To find out the entire process of achieving the above results, check out the code below.
I recommend downloading zip file with frames from the GitHub and upload it to your working directory. 

Link: https://github.com/Urban-Analytics/dust/tree/main/Projects/ABM_DA/experiments/grand_central_terminal_data/GCT_final_real_data

For some reason downloading and unzipping within R did not work as smoothly, hence I excluded this option from the code.

```{r, eval=FALSE} 
# read all frames (.dat files) at once into a list
setwd("/Users/gretatimaite/Desktop/pedestrian_simulation/GCS_data/frames") # set working directory to read files from; change the path as needed.
frames_l = list() # creates a list
listdat = dir(pattern = "*.dat") # creates the list of all the .dat files in the directory
for (k in 1:length(listdat)){
  frames_l[[k]] = read.delim(listdat[k],
                             header = T,
                             sep = "")
}
# === the commented code below shows why list needs sorting

# convert list to a df
# frames_df = data.frame(t(sapply(frames_l,c)))
# frames_df = frames_df |> 
#   # rename columns and keep only 3
#   dplyr::rename(pedestrianID = X.,
#                                 pedestrian_id = pedestrianID,
#                                 x_coord = pedestrianID,
#                                 y_coord = x) %>% 
#   dplyr::select(1:3) 

# problem: files are not read one by one (ie frame_0.0.dat, frame_1.0.dat,frame_3.0.dat)
# but alphabetically (ie. frame_0.0.dat, frame_1.0.dat,frame_10.0.dat)
# it messes up frame order

# Draw GCS environment in pixels

Coordinates in the trajectories data are in pixels, hence we need to draw it in pixels too.

# Flow

In this section flow of agents in the environment will be plotted. First, it will be done for the entire GCS and then it will be divided and flow measured in each of the newly created smaller polygon.

## Flow in GCS

```{r}
# the coordinates of frames_sf are in pixels, but having them in meters might make the analysis more intuitive.
# 1 metre = 14 pixels (also see `pixel_geo.R` script)
frames_sf_m = frames_sf |> 
  dplyr::mutate(geometry = geometry / 14)

# now let's create a new column for seconds
# 1 second = 25 frames
frames_sf_m = frames_sf_m |> 
  dplyr::mutate(sec = frame / 25)

# group df by seconds
frames_grouped = frames_sf_m |> 
  sf::st_drop_geometry() |> #drop geometry as it's not needed here
  dplyr::group_by(sec) |> # group by seconds
  dplyr::summarise(n = dplyr::n()) # summarise 

frames_grouped |> 
  head()
```

Now let's plot!

```{r}
# let's calculate mean and median values of n to add to the plot
frames_mean_s = frames_sf_m$sec |> mean()
frames_median_s = frames_sf_m$sec |> median()
frames_mean_n = frames_grouped$n |> mean()
frames_median_n = frames_grouped$n |> median()

ggplot2::ggplot(frames_grouped) +
  ggplot2::aes(x = sec,
               y = n) +
  ggplot2::geom_line() +
  ggplot2::geom_vline(xintercept = frames_mean_s,
                      col = "red") +
  ggplot2::geom_text(ggplot2::aes(x=frames_mean_s+5, label=paste0("Mean\n",round(frames_mean_s,2)), y=80)) +
  ggplot2::geom_vline(xintercept = frames_median_s, 
                      col = "blue") +
  ggplot2::geom_hline(yintercept = frames_mean_n,
                      col = "red") +
  ggplot2::geom_hline(yintercept = frames_median_n,
                      col = "blue")
```

I'm not sure if adding mean and median are useful at all..

## Flow in the divided GCS

First we need to divide the GCS polygon. In this example I will do it into equal 16 polygons (4x4). 

```{r}
# let's convert GCS environment (walls) into an sf object so we can apply spatial operations
# polygon(x = c(0, 0, 53, 53),
#         y = c(0, 50, 50,0),
#         border = "black",
#         lwd = 2) # draw walls of a GCS
matrix_walls = matrix(c(0,0,0,50,53,50, 53,0,0,0),
                      ncol = 2,
                      byrow = TRUE)
matrixlist_walls = list(matrix_walls)
polygon_walls = sf::st_polygon(matrixlist_walls)

# divide gcs polygon by creating a grid
gcs_div = sf::st_make_grid(polygon_walls, 
                           n = 4,
                           what = "polygons")
```

```{r}
# plot grid over gcs polygon to check their order (starts bottom left)
polygon_walls |> plot(reset = T)
gcs_div |> plot(add =T)
gcs_div[[1]] |> plot(add =T, col = "red")
gcs_div[[2]] |> plot(add =T, col = "blue")
gcs_div[[5]] |> plot(add =T, col = "green")
```

They look good to me. Now let's convert it into an sf object.

```{r}
# convert gcs_div to an sf object
gcs_div_sf = gcs_div |> 
  sf::st_as_sf() |> 
  dplyr::rename(geom = x)
```

Let's iterate through all 16 polygons to find out which rows (agents) are within each polygon

```{r}
# first create a list to store our multiple dataframes
gcs_frames_joined = list()
for (i in 1:lengths(gcs_div_sf)){
  gcs_frames_joined[[i]] = frames_sf_m[gcs_div_sf[i,], op = sf::st_within] # here I use `within` but it could be changes to `intersects`...
}

# sanity check
gcs_frames_joined1 = frames_sf_m[gcs_div_sf[1,], op = sf::st_within]
gcs_frames_joined2 = frames_sf_m[gcs_div_sf[2,], op = sf::st_within]
identical(gcs_frames_joined1, gcs_frames_joined[[1]]) # TRUE
identical(gcs_frames_joined2, gcs_frames_joined[[2]]) # TRUE
```

Now we will move to grouping and plotting each of the 16 polygons.

```{r}
# group each sf object by seconds and make a list out of them
gcs_frames_joined_grouped = list()
for (i in 1:length(gcs_frames_joined)){
  gcs_frames_joined_grouped[[i]] = gcs_frames_joined[[i]] |> 
    sf::st_drop_geometry() |> 
    dplyr::group_by(sec) |> 
    dplyr::summarise(n = dplyr::n())
}

# sanity check comparison (alert: ugly code!)
identical(gcs_frames_joined_grouped[[1]], # first list of a list that was just made
          gcs_frames_joined[[1]] |> # repeating the same code as in the loop above but only on 1 (the first) list 
            sf::st_drop_geometry() |> 
            dplyr::group_by(sec) |> 
            dplyr::summarise(n = dplyr::n()))
```

In the plot showing flow in the entire GCS environment, I added means and medians but this time I will exclude them as I do not know if it's valuable to have them at this stage. Plus, it will make the code shorter.

```{r}
# let's create a list of plots showing flow in each polygon
plots = list()
for (i in 1:length(gcs_frames_joined_grouped)){
  plots[[i]] = ggplot2::ggplot(gcs_frames_joined_grouped[[i]]) +
    ggplot2::aes(x = sec,
                 y = n) +
    ggplot2::geom_line() 
  # print(plots)
}
```

```{r}
# let's plot a polygons 1-4 and 12-15
gridExtra::grid.arrange(plots[[1]], plots[[2]],plots[[3]],plots[[4]], layout_matrix = rbind(c(1,2),c(3,4)))
gridExtra::grid.arrange(plots[[12]], plots[[13]],plots[[14]],plots[[15]], layout_matrix = rbind(c(1,2),c(3,4)))
```

Of course, all 16 plots could be overlapped instead of plotting them 4 at a time, but let's leave this for now.

# Density

Now we will explore the density of the polygons. The steps will be very similar to those from the "Flow" section.

Density = N / m2

N = number of agents

## GCS density

First, polygon area needs to be measured and then density can be found.
```{r}
# calculate area size
gcs_walls_area = polygon_walls |> sf::st_area()

# group by seconds and then measure density
gcs_d = frames_sf_m |> 
  sf::st_drop_geometry() |> 
  dplyr::group_by(sec) |> 
  dplyr::summarise(n = dplyr::n(),
                   frame = frame) |> 
  dplyr::mutate(
    density = n / gcs_walls_area 
  )

gcs_d |> head()
```

Time to plot density over time (seconds).

```{r}
plot_density = ggplot2::ggplot(gcs_d)+
  ggplot2::aes(x = sec,
               y = density)+
  ggplot2::geom_line()

ggplot2::ggplot(gcs_d)+
  ggplot2::aes(x = sec,
               y = density)+
  ggplot2::geom_line() +
  ggplot2::geom_line(data = gcs_d,
                     ggplot2::aes(x = sec,
                                  y = n),
                     col = "red")

print(plot_density)
```

It looks exactly like the flow plot as only metric (y axis) changed.

## Divided GCS density

```{r}
# find out the area size of each polygon
gcs_area = list()
for (i in 1:lengths(gcs_div_sf)){
  gcs_area[[i]] = sf::st_area(gcs_div_sf[[i]]) 
  print(gcs_area)
}
# make it a vector
gcs_area = gcs_area |>
  unlist() |>
  as.vector()

# add area as a new column
# frames_a = list()
# for (i in 1:length(gcs_frames_joined_grouped)){
#   frames_a[[i]] = gcs_frames_joined_grouped[[i]] |> dplyr::mutate(area = gcs_area[i])
# }
```

```{r}
# find density for each group in each list
frames_d = list()
for (i in 1:length(gcs_area)){
  frames_d[[i]] = frames_a[[i]] |> dplyr::mutate(density = n / gcs_area[i])
}
```

Plotting densities!
They should be identical to flow plots.

```{r}
plots_den = list()
for (i in 1:length(frames_d)){
  plots_den[[i]] = ggplot2::ggplot(frames_d[[i]]) +
    ggplot2::aes(x = sec,
                 y = density) +
    ggplot2::geom_line() 
  # print(plots_den)
}

# let's plot a polygons 1-4 and 5-8
gridExtra::grid.arrange(plots_den[[1]], plots_den[[2]],plots_den[[3]],plots_den[[4]], layout_matrix = rbind(c(1,2),c(3,4)))
gridExtra::grid.arrange(plots_den[[13]],plots_den[[14]],plots_den[[15]], plots_den[[16]], layout_matrix = rbind(c(1,2),c(3,4)))
```
