  abstract = {Agent-based models (ABMs) are used in the spatial sciences as building-blocks for computer simulation. ABMs have a range of advantageous attributes, not least of which is their flexibility in representing dynamic and highly adaptive physical or human phenomena. ABMs facilitate the exploration of ideas about the myriad of ways that geographical systems develop, behave, interact and evolve, often supporting experimentation with geographical systems in ways that are simply not possible in the real world. Indeed, in many cases, ABMs are developed from the bottom up, pedagogically, as a tool in building theory. Geographers’ work with ABMs has helped to strengthen existing ties with related disciplines such as computer science and informatics, ecology, sustainability science, economics, anthropology, political science and the earth sciences. Primarily because of the value placed on spatial science and behavioral geography in agent-based modeling, work of this kind is helping to infuse geographical perspectives and ‘spatial thinking’ into these fields. This article reviews the development of agent-based modeling in the spatial sciences, its current uses and applications in physical and human geography and potential future trends in its research and development.},

  abstract = {Agent-based modeling is a powerful simulation technique that allows one to build artificial worlds and populate these worlds with individual agents. Each agent or actor has unique behaviors and rules which govern their interactions with each other and their environment. It is through these interactions that more macro-phenomena emerge: for example, how individual pedestrians lead to the emergence of crowds. Over the past two decades, with the growth of computational power and data, agent-based models have evolved into one of the main paradigms for urban modeling and for understanding the various processes which shape our cities. Agent-based models have been developed to explore a vast range of urban phenomena from that of micro-movement of pedestrians over seconds to that of urban growth over decades and many other issues in between. In this chapter, we introduce readers to agent-based modeling from simple abstract applications to those representing space utilizing geographical data not only for the creation of the artificial worlds but also for the validation and calibration of such models through a series of example applications. We will then discuss how big data, data mining, and machine learning techniques are advancing the field of agent-based modeling and demonstrate how such data and techniques can be leveraged into these models, giving us a new way to explore cities.},

  abstract = {Agent-based models (ABMs) are gaining traction as one of the most powerful modelling tools within the social sciences. They are particularly suited to simulating complex systems. Despite many methodological advances within ABM, one of the major drawbacks is their inability to incorporate real-time data to make accurate short-term predictions. This paper presents an approach that allows ABMs to be dynamically optimized. Through a combination of parameter calibration and data assimilation (DA), the accuracy of model-based predictions using ABM in real time is increased. We use the exemplar of a bus route system to explore these methods. The bus route ABMs developed in this research are examples of ABMs that can be dynamically optimized by a combination of parameter calibration and DA. The proposed model and framework is a novel and transferable approach that can be used in any passenger information system, or in an intelligent transport systems to provide forecasts of bus locations and arrival times.},
