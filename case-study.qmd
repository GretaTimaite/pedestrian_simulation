Agent-based models have the power to improve our understanding of human movement and support data-informed decision-making, yet various uncertainties influencing model's accuracy are yet to be fully understood. Evaluating simulated data against real empirical data might help to overcome some of those issues.

## Project overview

<!-- Sticking to one paragraph (3-4 sentences) give the background of the project including project aims. Is there anything new or unique about this research?  -->

Agent-based models (AMB) have become one of the main computational modelling tools to improve the understanding of human movement within cities (crooks_etal2021). ABMs have been applied in a variety of contexts ranging from disease to pedestrian simulation (torrens_2010) as they can be used to assess, for example, the utility of new traffic intervention measures before their implementation (crooks_etal2021). Nevertheless, one of the key challenges remains the evaluation of the model's accuracy which is influenced by various uncertainties, such as missing data or inherent randomness (kieu_etal_2020). Thus, the **main aim of the project** is to address the issue of uncertainty^[Extended project summary can be found here: https://lida.leeds.ac.uk/exploring-the-efficacy-of-different-methods-for-comparing-pedestrian-simulations-against-empirical-data/]. This will be done by investigating and evaluating the impact of different methods on the reliability of ABM.


## Data and methods

<!-- Outline the; who, what, when, where and how of the study -->
### Data

The project relies on two sets of data -- empirical (real) and simulated. Empirical data of pedestrian trajectories was inferred from the video sequence at [the New York Grand Central Station (GCS)](https://www.ee.cuhk.edu.hk/~xgwang/grandcentral.html), which was originally used in Zhou et al.'s (2012) paper to study pedestrian dynamics. A subset of this data (3 minutes) was further cleaned by Patricia Ternes for Clay et al.'s (2021) paper.^[Jupyter Notebooks can be found on the GitHub repository: https://github.com/Urban-Analytics/dust/tree/main/Projects/ABM_DA/experiments/grand_central_terminal_data]. This subsetted data was used in this project as well.

[JuPedSim (JPS)](https://www.jupedsim.org/jupedsim_introduction.html), an open-source pedestrian simulation framework, was used to create a simulation of pedestrian movement at GCS. The data (simulated agent trajectories) then was compared against empirical data. Exact model parameters, including [files used to run the simulation](https://github.com/GretaTimaite/pedestrian_simulation/releases/tag/data)^[This includes the following files: geo.xml, agents_sources.xml, core_ini.xml], can be found on GitHub. 

### Environment

The environment for the simulation was designed to represent the GCS. This work had already been done by Ternes et al. (2022). However, to evaluate model's accuracy, two additional steps were taken:

1. Environment was divided into 4 equal polygons to better understand pedestrian movement in different regions of a train concourse;
2. Two smaller areas (Zone 1 and Zone 2) were selected in which Zone 1 has the same density as the whole environment and Zone 2 has the highest density in the GCS;

For more information on the environment and measure areas, please refer to the ["Environment" chapter](https://gretatimaite.github.io/gcs_jps/envir.html#global) in the online book developed for this project.

### Methods

To evaluate the accuracy of the JPS model, three key methods for measuring pedestrian dynamics were explored (steffen and Seyfried 2010): 

1. Flow which is a count of heads that pass through a line, such as doors;
2. Density (including Voronoi diagram) which is measured by counting heads per area;
3. Speed refers to a distance traveled from point A to point B over a given time period;

Additionally, fundamental diagrams (in this case a linear relationship between speed and density), was used to improve the understanding of pedestrian dynamics in both environments.

## Key findings

The most interesting, and the one that raises further questions, is the application of Voronoi diagram for evaluating JPS data against GCS data. Voronoi diagram is a method to partition a 2D space into regions, or cells, in which each cell "contains all the points closer to the related particle than to others.” (Xiao et al., 2016:568) Moreover, cells change every time an agent (here, a pedestrian) moves. As a result, each frame has, given that at least one agent moved, a differently divided 2D space. 

Voronoi diagrams, Steffen and Seyfried (2010) argue, can help to overcome some of the limitations of classical density by including, for instance, fractional counts (i.e. counting in an agent whose body (or a cell) intersects with an area of measure but is not fully within it). Hence, it is considered a more precise method (zhang_etal2011) and is used to understand pedestrian crowding at the bottlenecks (liao_etal2014) or T-junctions and straight corridors (zhang_etal2011) in the experimental settings. 

Given fractional counting, it is not surprising that Voronoi diagrams show higher densities in all but one measured areas (see Table 1). Surprising results emerge, however, when Voronoi diagram is computed for Zone 1. Not only does the Voronoi diagram for GCS Zone 1 make the biggest difference but also the most interesting pattern emerge. In the rest of the measured areas, Voronoi density tends to drop or increase in accordance with classical density. Yet, Zone 1 in both datasets seem to follow a different pattern (see Figure 1). 

![Table 1. Comparison of densities using Classical and Voronoi diagram measurement methods.](densities_quant.png)

Potentially, Voronoi density is so much higher for GCS Zone 1 compared to Classical one is that it captures uncertainty of agent movement. Active movement around Zone 1 might be influenced by the information booth and agents "window shopping" next to the Zone 1 but not entering it. This might have happened because GCS is not crowded enough. In other aforementioned experimental studies, in which Voronoi diagram was used, densities are higher, such as 2 or 3 individuals per squared meter. Low density, thus, might result in situations when Voronoi cells intersect with a measured area even though an agent itself might be a few meters away from, for instance, Zone 1. Arguably, this is a reason why Voronoi density for JPS Zone 1 has a "tail" -- based on the Classical density, there are no agents within Zone 1 but Voronoi cells of the (nearby) agents keep intersecting it (Voronoi diagram can be computed as long as there are two agents, thus dividing environment into two parts). This "cell intersection" might not be problematic and, indeed, happening at, for instance, bottlenecks which tend to have high density around measure area as well as within it due to the crowding. Finally, it might not be straightforward to calibrate a JPS model to reflect this "edge uncertainty", yet setting and calibrating intermediate goals for some of the agents might help to address some of this uncertainty.

## Value of the research

<!-- What is the impact, how will this benefit xyz? How could the research be applied to real-world problems or what is the usage/benefit? -->

The exploration of different methods to evaluate simulated data against real data helps to advance the understanding of pedestrian dynamics and potential pitfalls in modelling the movement. For example, a methodological choice between classical and Voronoi density measurements as well as the size of a measured area might influence the understanding of how much movement happens. Indeed, Voronoi diagram might help to capture the instances where agents move around the measured area but not inside it. This might be important when, for instance, a measured area is close to, but does not intersect with, an information booth or windows of a shop that permits "window shopping". The question is, then, not only whether a measured area should be enlarged to capture the uncertainty around the edges but also if the model can be calibrated to capture some of that uncertainty, such as "window shopping".

## Insights

- The study designs a pedestrian simulation based on the empirical rather than experimental data
- Voronoi diagram is a useful method to detect pedestrian activity around the area of measure
- However, Voronoi diagram needs to be further examined for its potential to inflate density in the (relatively) low density environments, such as train concourse
- Simulations for pedestrian movement in train concourse need to calibrate for the potential of an environment to impact agents movement, such as stopping for "window shopping"
